**KNOSSOS** visualizes large 3D (up to multiple terabyte) volume electron microscopic (e.g. Serial Block-Face EM) datasets by displaying slices. It supports skeleton and volume-based annotation modes, which can be extended by plugins written in Python.

It is developed at the *Max Planck Institute for Medical Research* in Heidelberg, Germany, for Windows, GNU/Linux and OS X. A similar, web-based implementation is being developed at [*webknossos.info*](https://webknossos.brain.mpg.de/spotlight).
