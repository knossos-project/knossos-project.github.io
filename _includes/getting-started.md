### Download **KNOSSOS**

**KNOSSOS** is available for Windows, GNU/Linux and OS X. Since **KNOSSOS** is an open-source program, we host our releases on Github. Head to our [Github repository <span class="icon fa-external-link"></span>](https://github.com/knossos-project/knossos) to download the appropriate version.

### Datasets

A special image format is required to use **KNOSSOS**. You have the choice to either try our example datasets, or learn how to create your own. Any dataset can be loaded into **KNOSSOS** by selecting its `.conf` file in `File - Choose Dataset...`, and clicking on *Use*.


#### Built-in Datasets

There are two datasets already built-in into **KNOSSOS**: `e2006` and `ek0563`. You can access them by opening the *Choose Dataset...* window, and selecting that dataset in the table.

#### Offline Datasets

These are offline datasets that already contain all pre-formatted images: [small (54 MB)]({{ "downloads/e1088_mag1_small.zip" | prepend: site.baseurl }}), [large (400 MB)]({{ "downloads/e1088_mag1_large.zip" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

#### Own datasets

If you have your own image datasets, they will probably need to be converted into **KNOSSOS'** format. Head to the  [Dataset Preparation]({{ "data/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) section to learn how to do so.

Feel free to [contact us](#contact-us) if you need any assistance in setting up **KNOSSOS**.
