Plugins
-------

Since **KNOSSOS** version 4.1, any user can extend **KNOSSOS'** functionality by writing Python plugins. We offer a public plugin repository where anyone can commit their plugins at our [knossos-plugins repository](https://github.com/knossos-project/knossos-plugins/tree/gh-pages).

A documentation to **KNOSSOS'** Python API is currently in development. To get a sneak peak at how to use Python inside of **KNOSSOS**, take a look at the sample plugins.
