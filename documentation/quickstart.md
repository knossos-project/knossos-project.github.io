# KNOSSOS Quickstart guide

This tutorial should give a very rough introduction and overview about KNOSSOS and its features.

KNOSSOS is a cross-platform scientific tool written in C++[^1] to visualize and annotate large image data, such as generated by _Serial Blockface Scanning Electron Microscopy (SBFSEM)_. Among others, it has also been used for annotating images from confocal light microscopy, cryo-electron tomography (CryoET) and multiplexed immunofluorescence imaging.

Here is a short summary of notable KNOSSOS features:

* Seamless navigation in datasets of unrestricted size by on-the-fly loading and unloading of image portions while moving through the dataset
* Visualization of orthogonal cross-sections and rotatable 3D view
* Seamless switching between image resolutions while zooming in and out
* Overlay of multiple channels
* Skeleton annotation using graphs to capture object morphologies
* Volume annotation tools for painting and merging supervoxels
* Mesh generation from volume annotation
* Customization with python plugins
* Work time tracking

[^1]: KNOSSOS uses the following libraries: Qt 5, QuaZIP, PythonQt, OpenGL, Boost, google-snappy, toml11.

## Getting KNOSSOS

Current KNOSSOS binaries for Linux, Mac and Windows can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/knossos-project/knossos/releases/tag/nightly).

Note: Don’t worry if Microsoft tries to warn you about potential malware because the antivirus scanner couldn’t detect KNOSSOS. [This is normal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/intelligence/criteria?view=o365-worldwide#unknown--unrecognized-software).

## Launching KNOSSOS

To get you started, select an example dataset in the Dataset Chooser at the top-left menu entry: `File` ‣ `Choose Dataset…`.
Before loading the dataset, you can adjust the FOV (Field of View). This specifies how many pixels/voxels are visible in the viewports, thereby controlling how much memory will be consumed.

[See here, to read how to load your own data in KNOSSOS…](https://TODO_link)

## Basic interface

Depending on whether you loaded a 2D image or 3D image stack, you will see a different interface:

* XY plane of the stack (upper left, red border)
* XZ plane of the stack (lower left, green border)
* ZY plane of the stack (upper right, blue border)
* 3D view of the annotation (lower right)

Navigation works e.g. with arrow keys or mouse dragging. You can also jump to specific locations by pasting x, y, z coordinates somewhere into the main window.

### Selecting a Work Mode
The work mode selection in the upper left determines the action set available to you. They will also be listed in the integrated cheatsheet. If it’s closed, open it via Help ‣ Cheatsheet.

* *Review*: Read-only workmode for viewing skeletonization and segmentation. Use this to avoid making accidental changes.
* *Tracing*: Simple skeletonization mode for creating and editing one connected tree.
* *Tracing Advanced*: Power user skeletonization mode, allows e.g. creating multiple trees, (un-)linking nodes, creating cycles…
* *Segmentation Merge*: Mode for merging and splitting existing supervoxels without editing supervoxel shapes themselves.
* *Merge Tracing*: Hybrid annotation mode. While tracing an object, supervoxels sharing the same tree will be merged.
* *Segmentation Paint*: Mode for modifying supervoxel shapes by painting and bucket filling.
* *Segmentation Overpaint*: Special painting mode that only relabels existing segmentation voxels without changing the background.
* *Segmentation Cell Painting*: Fast painting and grouping of nuclei, cytoplasm and cells.

[Read hear](/documentation/skeletonization_vs_segmentation.md) to learn more about the differences between skeletonization and segmentation.

The most relevant KNOSSOS window is the _Annotation Window_:

This window displays your annotation progress. Select either Tree View or Segmentation to see your skeleton structure/segmentation.

## Saving/Auto-saving/Loading

By default, the annotation data will be saved automatically with incrementing names every five minutes if changes have been made.
You can adjust this behavior in Preferences ‣ Save

A saved annotation is a .k.zip file – a simple zip archive that you can load again by dragging it into KNOSSOS.

## Comments

You can add a comment on trees and nodes by using the lists in the Annotation Window.

If you use some comments regularly, you can enter them in the Comments tab of the Annotation Window, and add them to the active node by pressing F1-F10.

If you enable Use custom comment colors and Use custom comment radius, you can also specify the highlighting color and radius for these nodes.
